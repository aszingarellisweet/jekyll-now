## Hello!
I am a museum librarian and cataloger with expertise in the fine arts, special formats, and Classical and European languages. I'm dedicated to developing and maintaining more efficient, sustainable, meaningful, and just knowledge infrastructures to continue connecting people with cultural heritage resources in a rapidly changing world. My interests include transforming MARC, evaluating the climate impacts of library data, and related applications of minimal computing. 

I am presently the Assistant Librarian at the George Eastman Museum's Richard and Ronay Menschel Library, and previously held cataloging positions at Cal State Northridge and the Autry Museum of the American West. I hold an MLIS in archives and information science from the University of Pittsburgh iSchool and an MA in art history from the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University. 

I live in the Genesee Valley, New York, with my wife and our scrappy terrier mutt, and I enjoy lower peak hiking, detective novels, and killing it at pub trivia.

Everything herein is my own opinion and does not represent my employer or any other organization I am affiliated with.
